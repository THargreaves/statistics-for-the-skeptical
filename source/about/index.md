Hi, I'm [Tim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hargreaves/). I am an undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics student working as a data scientist at the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. My key focuses include effective visualisation, non-parametric statistical methods, and interpretable machine learning.

'Statistics for the Skeptical' was born out my frustration towards the blatant disrespect for statistics that many news and media outlets demonstrate in the modern, attention-hungry ecosystem, and the impacts of such foul-play on public trust and understanding. I was tipped over the edge when my commute was spoiled by the Radio 4 morning news featuring deceptive statistics relating to supposed changes in the rate of violent crime in the UK. This led me to produce [a talk](https://github.com/THargreaves/statistics-for-the-skeptical-wids) for the Warwick International Development Society in which I dissected this and many other examples of poor statistical thinking that often come up in our daily lives.

This blog is a continuation of this project. Each post tackles a statistical fallacy, focusing on a real-world example that I have come across in my life, and how one can avoid falling for these tricks in the future. I hope you enjoy the series and learn some useful reasoning skills in the process.

Thanks for reading and, most importantly, **stay skeptical**.
